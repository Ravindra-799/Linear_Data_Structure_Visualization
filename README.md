# Linear_Data_Structure_Visualization
The project Linear Data Structure Visualization is aims to visualization of the operations are being perform the data items/elements into data structure in the animation way. Generally, a
student who wants to learn the data structure in the beginning stage it is somewhat difficult to the understanding of operations being perform on the data structures. As we started learning data
structures in our first semester, we came across this problem and for the better understanding we search on the google and we found that many websites (which are designed based on the UI
technologies) only representing in static way but not the exactly what happens when an operation being applied on the data structure internally. So, we came upcome with the solution by this
project.

This project is mainly design in such a way that for the better understanding of the operations are being perform on the data structure with clearcut representation with the of
animations of the data elements/items and memory allocation based on their respective address locations for the data elements which are being allocated at each and every stage based on the
inputs given by the user dynamically. And also, as we mentioned previously the problem which was faced in our beginning days of learning of the data structures as there was no well-known website or application which
demonstrates the what happens internally in the data structures when we give the inputs dynamically in the animation way and also in what way the memory being allocated at each and
every stage.
